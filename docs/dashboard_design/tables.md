# Table design
Always assess the information you are working with and display it in the clearest style possible. This section demonstrates a number of ways to present information.

## Best practices
???- tip "Simplicity"
    - [x] Minimal use of borders, with a few line rules to distinguis column headings and totals.
    - [x] White space is used to separate columns.
    - [x] Title and subheadings are in bold so that they stand out.
    - [x] Please ensure there are consistent colours across tabs for tables and charts by using NHS blues, tints and highlight colours.

???- tip "Alignment"
    - [x] Right align column headings and the numbers in the column (the exception being the first column category title which is left aligned)
    - [ ] Don't use centred of variable alignments. Right align to better highlight the difference in values at the same level of precision.

???- tip "Date formats"
    - [x] Use "FY 2017/18" format for financial year. You can bring this from the date dimension during data preparation/
    - [x] Use "Q1 2019" or "Quarter 1, 2019" for date quarters
    - [x] Use "January 2019" or "Jan 19" to display month.
    - [x] Use "4 January 2019", "4 Jan 19" or "04/01/2019" for days.
    - [x] Use "Wednesday, 4 January 2019", "Wednesday" or "Wed" for weekday.

???- tip "Numbers"
    - [x] Always use commas to indicate thousands, millions, billion: £1,234,567.89
    - [x] Always start with zero for values less than 1 (Example: 0.756 not .756)
    - [x] Always use a consistent level of precision within a table
    - [x] Ensure negative values are indicated by a minus sign (Example: -65)
    - [x] Round data in a way to sufficiently convey value and add context to data, but don't oversell confidence in data quality through being too acurate. For example £123,234.59 implies a confidence in the data quality to the nearest penny. Whereas if the data quality is lower, or submitted data is unvalidated, a lower significance level should be give, eg £123,230.
    - [x] Percentages shouldn't be at a greater detail than 1dp unless specifically required
    - [x] Use the lowest possible level of detail depending on the the intended audience

## Thin tables
- Try to minimuse the data-ink ratio
- Right align column header and numerical values
- Font sizes as in the <a href="../typography">typography list</a>.
- Header text alignment should be vertical middle and right

![Thin tables](../../images/thin_tables.png){ data-title="Thin tables" data-description=".custom-desc1" data-caption-position="left" data-gallery="tables"}
<div class="glightbox-desc custom-desc1">

</div>

## Wide tables
- Shading allows the user to keep their eye on a specific row as they scan from left to right
- Table header colour: #D8DDE0
- Alternate row colour: #F0F4F5
- Text colour: #212B32

![Wide tables](../../images/wide_tables.png){ data-title="Wide tables" data-description=".custom-desc2" data-caption-position="left" data-gallery="tables"}
<div class="glightbox-desc custom-desc1">

</div>

## Text tables
- Text should be left-aligned, and the headers should be right-aligned for the column
- Table header colour: #D8DDE0
- Alternate row colour: #F0F4F5
- Text colour: #212B32

![Text tables](../../images/text_tables.png){ data-title="Text tables" data-description=".custom-desc3" data-caption-position="left" data-gallery="tables"}
<div class="glightbox-desc custom-desc3">

</div>

## National standards
National standards should be clearly labelled in a table or chart wherever applicable.

 - If multiple metrics with multiple difference national standards are shown, label these in the table
![National standards table](../../images/national_standards_table.png){ width="500px" data-title="National standards table" data-description=".custom-desc4" data-caption-position="left" data-gallery="tables"}
<div class="glightbox-desc custom-desc4">
Example of a national standards table
</div>


 - To highlight whether national standards are met in a table, colour the text in RAG colours or add a background 20% RAG colour. 
RAG rating should only be used where there is a national standard being met or not met, otherwise it should not be used.
![National standards table](../../images/rag_table.png){width="500px" data-title="National standards table" data-description=".custom-desc5" data-caption-position="left" data-gallery="tables"}
<div class="glightbox-desc custom-desc5">
