# Style guide rules

## Dashboard layout

Visual Hierarchy is the organisation of design elements by importance. It is best practice to use a Z-formation, which draws the users' attention to the top-left corner first before moving to the top right, then down to the bottom left, and finally the bottom-right corner. Just like how you would read a book.

<div class="layout-container">
<!-- Z layout 1 -->
<div class="z1-container">
  <div class="layout-square arrow-right">1</div>
  <div class="layout-square arrow-diagonal">2</div>
  <div class="layout-square" style="grid-column: span 2 / span 2; width: 96%">3</div>
</div>
<!-- Z layout 2 -->
<div class="z2-container">
  <div class="layout-rect">1</div>
  <div class="layout-rect">2</div>
  <div class="layout-rect">3</div>
</div>
<!-- Z layout 3 -->
<div class="z1-container">
  <div class="layout-square arrow-right">1</div>
  <div class="layout-square arrow-diagonal">2</div>
  <div class="layout-square arrow-right">3</div>
  <div class="layout-square">4</div>
</div>
</div>

## NHS logo
Always place the NHS logo in the top right hand corner of your dashboard with a 100px width and a 40px height. The padding around the logo is 30px.
