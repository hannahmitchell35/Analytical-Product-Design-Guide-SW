# Information and metric pages
Text based pages are useful in dashboards to provide further context and an overview of the information being presented. These can be in the form of 'Information' or 'Metric' pages'

## Information / about page

We should use an 'Information' or 'About' page to provide the user with details about what the dashboards objectives are, data sources and contact details for the author.
