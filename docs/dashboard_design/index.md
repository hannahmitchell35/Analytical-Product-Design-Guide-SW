# Dashboard design

We convey our visual identity through the products we build. Design guidelines help us to work together on sophisticated digital products, using a standardised visual language. 

The NHS Identity is one of the most recognised and cherished brands in the world. It evokes trust and reassurance.

> Branding is the art of becoming knowable, likable, and trustable.

A style guide helps us to ensure a continuous brand experience for our users. When style is applied consistently across NHS products, it fosters loyalty and trust across all user touch-points.

These guidelines are for developers, product owners and quality assurance testers working on data visualisation products in the NHS.
