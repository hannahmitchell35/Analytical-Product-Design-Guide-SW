# Data Visualisation Style Guide Launch

The NHS England Data Visualisation Service launched its latest release of the [NHS Data Visualisation Style Guide](dashboard_design/quick_summary.md) and associated [NHS Tableau Templates](dashboard_design/download_templates.md).
 
Following User Centred Design principles, the style guide sets out [the rules](dashboard_design/quick_summary.md) and [best practices](dashboard_design/principles.md) that you should follow when building your dashboard, which are tool-agnostic and universally applicable. This a big step forward towards delivering a consistent user experience across data visualisation products in the NHS!
 
The [NHS Tableau Templates](dashboard_design/download_templates.md) contain the prepopulated NHS styles to make your life easier when developing a dashboard in Tableau. Using the templates as the starting point for development will give you the tools to cut your development time in half. Say goodbye to fiddly formatting tweaks, we have gone through that pain for you - so you never have to endure it again!
