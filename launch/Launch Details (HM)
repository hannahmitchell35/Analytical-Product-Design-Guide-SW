# ðŸ§­ Overview: What the `index.html` Code Does

This HTML file builds the homepage of the **NHS Analytical Product Design Guide â€“ South West** using the [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.

It acts as a launchpad for:
- Style guidance for dashboard/report design (e.g. in Tableau)
- Standardized templates and naming conventions
- Clear navigation to best practices and resources
