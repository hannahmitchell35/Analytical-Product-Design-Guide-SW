They should be shown with a black dashed (not dotted) line and \"standard = n%\" label. SPC charts Approaches popular in the NHS, such as red, amber, green (RAG) rating and two point comparisons, have limitations for good decision-making. An example RAG table The table above contains a lot of data but key messages such as \"Are we improving or declining?\" are very hard to determine. These two specialities when viewed as an SPC chart with more data, show a more informative picture. Clearly, conversations with these two specialities should be different, something the RAG table would not have suggested. An example SPC chart SPC charts will allow you to understand when something statistically significant is happening, caused by an external factor, rather than the natural variation of the system. SPC can help to avoid tampering and the costs associated with it. It can also help you to determine if, given the variance of the system, a target can be met and how reliably. This will help to guide you when a system needs a complete re-design, an improvement cycle, or is in fact capable. You can use SPC anywhere you have a metric that displays variance in between a time period. The data does not have to have a normal distribution. Caution: Although there are many benefits to using SPC charts, they should also be applied with caution. If there are situations where your data set displays seasonality, autocorrelation or small data sets, then additional research on how to construct an SPC accurately is necessary. Caution should also be taken with users, as interpreting an SPC chart not only requires understanding on how to interpret SPC charts, but a proper knowledge of the data and it's relationship with other information to avoid incorrect conclusions. Consider whether including SPC will benefit the conversation.

Otherwise your visualisation will be confusing. If you need to plot more than 5 variables, you should consider alternative ways to visualise this information. For any reasons, if we have to use more than five colours in a visualisation (to show multiple values on the same graph where no measure is more important than another e.g. plotting A&E attendances at different hospitals over time) then use the colours listed below.

You should avoid having separate filters for each view, unless there is a strong reason to do so. Users should not have to search around the page to cancel previous choices. Make sure the values in the quick filter are ordered in a way that makes sense for your data. You can specify the order of a quick filter by setting the default sort order for that field. If your user can make multiple selections within a filter dropdown, then use an 'apply' button. This stops the dashboard from refreshing whilst the user is still choosing their selections. Slider filters are great for date and numerical values, while list filters are better for categorical data. If your filter is continuous it may show date and times when published to prod, you can avoid this by making your date filter discrete with Day(Date), Month(Date) etc. Discrete date filters can be set to the latest date value in the data source. If your users require start and end date on the slider filter, this will not automatically update when new data comes through. To avoid this, instead of filtering on a range of dates, choose 'all dates' on the 'special' tab and turn the filter into a slider, as per the image to the right. Filters summary The filters on a dashboard should span across the width of the navigation and be left aligned to the dashboard. Maximum of two rows (10 filters) should be displayed on a dashboard. If more filters are required, they should be included in the advanced filters 'advanced filters' container. Filters should always show a reset link, which resets all of the filters applied including the advanced filters. When adding filters to a dashboard do not change the font colour and size on the worksheet. The font colour will be set in the template. Advanced filters button is optional and should be added only if there are more than 10 filters. Filters size, padding and colours All filters should be equal in width The filter card should be a white container with 16px inner padding and a 2px shadow (refer to cards page for further details) The filters should be in a horizontal container within the card with a background colour of #D8DBDC The inner padding of each filter should be 16px left (except the further left filter) and 16px right Each filter should have a white background The outer padding of each filter should be 1px left (except the furthest left filter) to give the break lines The filter title should be arial, bold and size 11 There can be any number of filters on a dashboard but a maximum of five should display in a row. Example of size of filters Filters - empty slot: - If there are <5 filters on a dashboard, then the rest of the filter container slots should be left as empty and set a variable width similar to the other filter containers Filter layout (two rows) Filters should always show a reset link, which resets all of the filters applied including the advanced filters. Only five filters should appear in a row for desktop, for 10 filters they must break into two rows. When adding filters to a dashboard do not change the font colour and the size on the worksheet. The font colour will be set in the template. 'Advanced filters' button is optional and should only be added if there are more than 10 filters. Example of filters with two rows Filters with radio buttons & sliders Radio buttons and sliders can be used as filters which can be used to change the view of the data. Radio buttons should have maximum 2 options, else use a dropdown filter. Example of filters with radio buttons & sliders Filters in context If any filters are only applicable for a certain visualisation then those filters should be placed within its card layout, as shown below. Example of filters in context Advanced filters - No information required This set of advanced filters does not require any information to explain all/any advanced filters. Example of advanced filters with no information required Advanced filters - Short information required This set of advanced filters requires short information to explain all/any filters.

Example of advanced filters with short information required Advanced filters - Long information required This set of advanced filters requires long information to explain all/any filters. Example of advanced filters with long information required Buttons How to add a button on the dashboard Dashboard button Tableau has an in-built button object used to navigate from one page to another within a dashboard. You can use the 'navigation' object on the bottom left hand side. Drag it to the dashboard like any other object. Click the 'edit button' to define its attributes. You can add this button as an image or as a text box. Test it in the presentation mode to make sure it is working correctly. Note if you edit the background colour of the button it will appear unchanged unless in presentation mode or on server. Button to reset all filters in a dashboard The method to use buttons as filters can also be used as a 'reset button'. Create a new worksheet, this will become your button. Use the square mark. (This stops the button highlighting as blue when the sheet is selected). To add text to your button, use a label. This can be using the field or static text. Fit to entire view. If the square still appears behind text even when the square size is maxed, you can add \u201c1\u201d to the marks card as a colour, then edit the colour to what you want. Now when the worksheet is selected the square will appear as a border instead. Add any default values (for resetting parameters) to the marks card eg as details. Add your button worksheet to your dashboard. Create a filter dashboard action. Ensure the filters you want to unfilter are named in the selected fields section. Ignore the missing field message. You can add as many filters as you want to reset to the single action. To unfilter/reset parameters to a default, create a change parameter dashboard action. Ensure the default value you want to set the parameter to is placed in the source field and the clearing selection area. You will need a parameter action per parameter you want to reset. Controls Filters with controls Dashboards may require extra controls alongside the filters. The purpose of controls is to change the way the measures are being calculated rather than removing data. Eg: Absolute values, 7 day rolling average, population rates. Note: Controls and filters will both work in conjunction to refine the data. Example of a filter with controls Toggles (weighted data) Where it is helpful to show data by different groupings, for example a crude or weighted view, or if your view needs to switch between provider & commissioner, you can add a single value button toggle. Alternatively, a multiple value drop down could be used. Depending on your data source structure, this may be a filter or a parameter. If your data has one column consisting of text values \u201cprovider\u201d or \u201ccommissioner\u201d, then a filter toggle would be the best approach. If your data has one column with provider IDs and one with commissioner IDs, then a parameter toggle would be best. Combine the parameter with a calculated field to return the appropriate column name when each toggle option is selected. This calculated field would then be used in the view.","title":"Filters & buttons"},{"location":"dashboard_design/filters/#filters-buttons","text":"Filters example","title":"Filters &amp; buttons"},{"location":"dashboard_design/filters/#filters","text":"Good practice Selecting all dates in filter settings Filters should be applied to all the views in one dashboard.

The following page template is used across the product, particularly for report pages. it is best practice to use a Z-formation, like how you would read a book. For more details see the principles page . General rules 32px margin on all sides of the dashboard as per NHS England identity guidelines. 16px padding on top, bottom, left and right of cards. For further information visit the cards page . 32px spacing between cards on the dashboard. Minimum font size 11px or 11pt. Utilise various weights to establish a hierarchy. Be consistent in size, boldness and colour. All text should be sentence case. Dashboard background colour #F0F4F5 (NHS Grey 5). If the viz is going to show more data (more lines/bars) use the full width card so it helps the user to digest information quickly. Example dashboard layout annotated with padding and spacing Header On the left should be the dashboard title, subtitle if used, a brief dashboard description and an alert/message banner if needed. On the right should be the NHS logo and any data refresh information. Useful tips for header section Use either tabs or buttons for navigation purposes. Not both. This repetition makes the header look busy. Do not use the 'Hide note' functionality in the header section. Avoid using icons/images in the header area to redirect users to different dashboards. Clicking on icons without labels is not intuitive. Multiple icons increases visual clutter. Instead move the icons next to relevant / related visualisations outside of the header section. Add links to related dashboards and supporting webpages to an 'information & guidance' page or a 'related dashboards' page. See the Download templates page for details on how to download and use the templates.

In Tableau, these two sections would each be in a separate container sat within an overall top of page horizontal container. On the left should be the dashboard title, subtitle if used, a brief dashboard description and an alert/message banner if needed. This section should be no more than 1200px. On the right should be the NHS logo and any data refresh information. This section should be a fixed width of 300px. Header example Titles and subtitles For easy identification and navigation, every tab should show the workbook title (NHS Grey1, 24pt, Arial, sentence case), and the subtitle which matches the tab name (Black, 24pt, Arial, sentence case), with a black hyphen with spaces either side between the two names. A brief description of what the tab is showing can be added. Data refresh date The data refresh date should be shown to the left of the NHS logo in dashboards using the web wrapper. For dashboards not using the web wrapper the data refresh should be to the right of the page underneath the navigation bar(s). Margins Left, top and right margins should be 32 pixels. The bottom of each page should show an NHS Blue line (height = 2 pixels) and contact information. Additional information on latest data available is an optional extra. NHS identity See the icons & logos page for details on the NHS logo Text and image alignment All text and images should be left aligned to improve accessibility. Dashboard sizing & device layouts Tableau provides different types of sizing for dashboards which are fixed, range and automatic. Tableau provides different device layouts , which display a different layout of the dashboard depending on what device is viewing the dashboard such as desktop, tablet or phone. Fixed, range & automatic sizing Fixed sizing (Default recommended option) The dashboard remains the same size, regardless of the size of the window used to display it. If the dashboard is larger than the window, it becomes scrollable. Lets you specify the exact location and position of objects, which can be useful if there are floating objects which are often used for \"show/hide\" implementations where dynamic zones are not suitable. These will load faster because a fixed width dashboard can be cached on Tableau server. Less development work and testing is required as you do not have to test multiple screen sizes and monitors to ensure the dashboard appears and functions as expected. When using the recommended 1200px width, there will be no horizontal scroll bar for the vast majority of common screen sizes. Range sizing (Valid use case under the right conditions) The dashboard scales between minimum and maximum sizes that you specify. If the window displaying the dashboard is smaller than the minimum size, scroll bars are displayed. If it is larger than the maximum size, white space is displayed. Use this setting when you are designing for two different display sizes that need the same content and have similar shapes - such as small and medium sized browser windows. 1200 to 1840px range width is recommended in these use cases. For larger monitors certain charts will be wider and be easier to read and interpret. Developers must ensure that the dashboard displays correctly at all screen sizes, this requires more development work and testing. These will load slower as they are unable to use a cached version on the server. Floating containers cannot be used effectively, restricting certain features for users. Automatic sizing (not recommended) The dashboard automatically resizes to fill the window used to display it. Use this setting if you want Tableau to take care of resizing. For best results, use a tiled dashboard layout. This setting is not recommended NHS England recommendation on which sizing to use Default recommended option: 1200px fixed width dashboard Suitable for a wide range of screen sizes used by a diverse user base Enables better feature development using a full range of Tableau functionality (e.g floating containers for show/hide) Speed improvements in dashboard performance Less development and testing required Valid use case under the right conditions: 1840px fixed width dashboard Where the user base is entirely analytical Where all screen sizes are known or dashboard is designed for a permanent screen (e.g a control room) Note that users accessing dashboards with smaller monitors will have a horizontal scroll bar and may omit elements of the dashboard. It is recommended to add an information note on the dashboard to explain that it is best viewed on a wide screen monitor (i.e 1920px width at 100% display scaling). Valid use case under the right conditions: 1200px to 1840px width range dashboard Where the user base is entirely analytical Where a wide range of screen sizes is used by different users This will allow certain visuals such as line charts and bar charts to expand to monitors that are wider. This benefit must be weighed against the performance trade off of slower load times, more development/testing and reduced Tableau functionality in responsive range dashboards Device layouts Dashboards can be designed to show different views based on the device that is viewing the dashboard. For dashboards that are viewed directly on server, Tableau applies the following rules to display each device layout. If the smallest iframe dimension is... This device layout appears... 500 pixels or less Phone Between 501 and 800 pixels Tablet Greater than 800 pixels Desktop These different views are created in Tableau using the device preview button. The default view is the full sized view that is designed by default. Adding in tablet and phone views will allow your dashboard to be viewed correctly by those devices. The templates have default (desktop), tablet and phone views included already. Anything created or amended in the default view should be checked in the tablet and phone views afterwards before publishing This is recommended to be done at the end of the development process to avoid rework across all three views. Desktop (range above 800 pixels) If the user is looking at the dashboard in a browser that is less than 1200 pixels width then a horizontal scroll bar should appear. If the user is viewing the dashboard in a browser that is wider than 1840 pixels, then the dashboard has to be centre aligned to the screen by leaving space on either side. Based on the screen size, the width of the elements (filter dropdowns, KPIs) should change but not the space between them. Five filters per row. Six KPIs per row. Tablet (range between 501 - 800 pixels) If the user is viewing the dashboard in a screen range between 501 - 800 pixels, then the tablet layout should be populated. Three filters per row. Four KPIs per row. Please note, as users will not be able to do the hover on touch devices (mobile & tablet), avoid tooltips and hover actions. It is advisable to complete you dashboard before setting this functionality up, otherwise each time you make changes to the dashboard, they need to be done in both views. Based on the screen size, the width of the elements (filter dropdowns, KPIs) should change but not the space between them. Mobile (range under 501 pixels) If the user is viewing the dashboard in a screen range of 500 pixels or fewer, then the mobile layout should be populated. Three filters per row. Four KPIs per row. Although we have identified a few patterns/examples on how we can simplify and present the data on mobile devices, we should still look at each dashboard individually to suggest any recommendations or simplify further. Because of the limited space on mobiles, wherever possible please present only key important information. If the user requires a deeper analysis we will ask them to visit the desktop version. Do not put graphs side by side. Please note, as users will not be able to use the hover on touch devices (mobile & tablet) avoid tooltips and hover actions. It is advisable to complete your dashboard before setting up this functionality, otherwise each time you make changes to the dashboard, they need to be done in both views. An example, shown below, for simplifying multiple visualisations with complex data for mobile layouts, is to show only the highest values in a tabular format rather than showing the visualisation. \u2198 The example below, shows how complex tabular data can be simplified for mobile devices. Rather than showing multiple days in the table, we could give an option for the user to select a day in additional filters. \u2192 Further simplifications could be to limit charts to the top three by default with the option to show all. \u2192 Avoid scroll bars In general you should try to avoid scroll bars in your products. However, where the use of a scroll bar is necessary, ensure that there is only one scroll bar on your dashboard either vertical or horizontal. Not two vertical scroll bars (one applied for the browser and the second one applied to a component within the dashboard).","title":"Layout"},{"location":"dashboard_design/layout/#general-layout","text":"Layout done perfectly, will be invisible to the user.

It directs a user's attention to enhance their engagement of the information presented. Visual Hierarchy The first place your eyes go to is the top of the screen . Place important information here for users to easily scan. There are two primary reading layouts : Z pattern and F pattern. A Z-pattern layout draws attention to the top-left corner first before moving to the top right, then down to the bottom left, with the bottom-right corner as the last stop. Each corner has a visual cue (like a logo) or CTA (like a contact button). An F-pattern layout , which follows a more crowded pattern leading visitors from left to right and back again, works well for text-heavy pages. White Space White space separates and groups elements in a dashboard. It helps the eye to scan a page for information. Without it, your dashboard will be hard to read. Adding white space reinforces the visual hierarchy of your dashboard. It puts the spotlight on the data in your dashboard. Click here for more examples of using white space in practice. Data-ink ratio Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away. Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry Definition The data-ink ratio is a concept introduced by Edward Tufte. He refers to data-ink as the non-erasable ink used for the presentation of data. If data-ink would be removed from the image, the graphic would lose the content. The non-erasable portion of a graph is subjective, so Tufte follows up his principal of data-ink with the five laws of data-ink. Five laws of data-ink Above all else show the data Maximise the data-ink ratio Erase non-data ink Erase redundant data-ink Revise and edit Redesign of a bar chart The data-ink ratio on this chart can be reduced significantly by taking the following actions: remove backgrounds remove redundant labels remove borders remove colours remove special effects remove bolding lighten labels lighten lines or remove lines direct label Remember, 'less is more' Contrast Contrast directs the user's attention to focal point in your dashboard, highlighting important information to achieve impact. It is also crucial for practical reasons. For instance, text should have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 to ensure your dashboard is accessible to all users. Contrast in size, shape and colour are all important to ensure your dashboard is successful in achieving its specific goal. With no contrast all, you'd just end up with a single coloured block for a dashboard! Size and Scale Size and scale are used in visual hierarchy to communicate prioritized information. Size refers to the physical dimensions of an element, while scale defines its proportion relative to other elements on the page. Large elements generally attract more attention in the hierarchy, while smaller ones are secondary. Manipulating the size and scale of your dashboard components creates a sense of perspective, guiding users to focus on the most important information first. Naming conventions Naming of products is key, particularly in the context of an A-Z product list within the core platform. We are aware from user research that discoverability of products is an issue. Naming of products is a key aspect to be addressed to improve discoverability. Alongside the name, the brief description is also valuable in helping the user find the data they are looking for. Guidelines for naming new dashboards Start with key word(s) eg Cancer, COVID, A&E Consider frequency eg daily, weekly, monthly Describe functionality eg monitoring, performance, forecasting, benchmarking Keep it simple and descriptive Avoid unnecessary words and especially at the start of the name where it affects the alphabetical listing. Where possible avoid using acronyms. If an acronym needs to be included in the product title, ensure it is also written out in full. Eg Summary emergency department indicator table (SEDIT) Consider alphabetical listing Ensure the key word(s) is at the start of the sentence, this also ensures similar dashboards are grouped together. Do not start the name with 'the'. Eg 'The long stays' dashboard would appear under 't' in an alphabetical list, use 'Long stays' instead. Avoid starting names with 'NHS' or 'national' for the same alphabetical clustering reason. There may be exceptions eg 'NHS 111' Case Type Capitalisation is generally to be avoided in accordance with NHS style guidelines. Titles should use sentence case as per the NHS England style guidelines , capitalisation just like in standard English sentences, where only the first word of each sentence and proper nouns are capitalised. Managing versions If an updated version of a dashboard is released it should ideally replace the previous version and use the existing name. However if it is required for a new version to be added and the previous version to be still available then it should be clearly distinguishable eg 'A&E daily performance (new)' and 'A&E daily performance (2021). Dealing with data quality issues Sharing known data quality issues can reduce misinterpretation of data. Data quality check list Unfortunately the data we use is not always 100% complete, or 100% accurate. Adding a page to the dashboard or linking to a supporting web page to include information on data quality can be very useful for users. Try adding information such as: Missing submissions Known missing or incorrect data Dates highlighting when new metrics were introduced or methodologies were changed Known data quality issues The data quality page and metric descriptions page can be combined into one metric information page.

Try adding information such as: Missing submissions Known missing or incorrect data Dates highlighting when new metrics were introduced or methodologies were changed Known data quality issues The data quality page and metric descriptions page can be combined into one metric information page. External Links Disclaimer NHS England makes every effort to ensure that external links are accurate, up to date and relevant, however we cannot take responsibility for pages maintained by external providers. NHS England is not affiliated with any of the websites or companies in the links to external websites. If you come across any external links that do not work, we would be grateful if you could report them by raising an issue on our Data Viz Community of Practice GitHub .","title":"Dealing with data quality issues"},{"location":"dashboard_design/quick_summary/","text":"Style guide rules Dashboard layout Visual Hierarchy is the organisation of design elements by importance.

Dashboard sizing Default recommended option: 1200px fixed width dashboard Suitable for a wide range of screen sizes used by a diverse user base Enables better feature development using a full range of Tableau functionality (e.g floating containers for show/hide) Speed improvements in dashboard performance Less development and testing required Valid use case under the right conditions: 1840px fixed width dashboard Where the user base is entirely analytical Where all screen sizes are known or dashboard is designed for a permanent screen (e.g a control room) Note that users accessing dashboards with smaller monitors will have a horizontal scroll bar and may omit elements of the dashboard. It is recommended to add an information note on the dashboard to explain that it is best viewed on a wide screen monitor (i.e 1920px width at 100% display scaling). Valid use case under the right conditions: 1200px to 1840px width range dashboard Where the user base is entirely analytical Where a wide range of screen sizes is used by different users This will allow certain visuals such as line charts and bar charts to expand to monitors that are wider. This benefit must be weighed against the performance trade off of slower load times, more development/testing and reduced Tableau functionality in responsive range dashboards For more information on sizing, click here . Case Dashboard titles and Tabs should be in sentence case, which means only the first letter of each sentence should be capitalised. Workbook names should be in title case, which means that the first letter of each key word should be capitalised. The small, minor words such as in, of, with, at, and, etc should be in lower case.

From low levels of fidelity sketching to high levels of fidelity prototypes, each has its place in communicating your dashboard ideas to stakeholders and for generating feedback. Each type is a way to validate or invalidate our assumptions. They simulate the experience we want to deliver without requiring us to build the real thing. You shouldn't worry about making them perfect as long as they communicate the idea and are appropriate for the feedback you are aiming to get. Sketches Sketching is an important part of UX design. You do not need to be a natural born artist to be able to sketch meaningful designs. Sketching allows you to form and evolve ideas at speed. Wireframes Wireframes serve as a middle ground between sketches and your first prototype. They help you plan the layout and interaction patterns of your users without distracting details like colours or copy. The user journey should be clear without needing colour or shading or fancy menus. A wireframe is a low fidelity layout of the design which has three simple but direct targets: To present the main information group. To draw the outline of structure and layout To provide the vision and description of the user interface. A wireframe has very obvious visual limitations as it usually only shows lines, boxes and different greyscale colours. Prototypes Prototypes are early models of your product built to test a concept and learn from it. They are designed to emulate not just the functionality of the product but also the look and feel. Where possible, develop prototypes with the intention of recycling code from the prototype into the finished product. Wireframing best practices To bring the best out of the wireframes and to set a proper foundation for the next step of the process UI, follow these several simple rules below. Understand the goals, objectives and key functionalities of the dashboards before building a wireframe. It will be a great help to have the use cases available before starting on the wireframes. Ask the business analysts / product managers to provide the use cases, approved by stakeholders. Wherever possible use real data. If real data is not available, use 'meaningful but random data'. This should start with having some information about the data - the approximate number of data points for example, their range and spread, and so on. Use the simple design of the components / visualisations - adding detailed components will take you a lot of time and effort without being particularly useful. Maintain consistency - similar components must look the same on all your wireframes. Use annotations to describe the functionality / logic to the developers. Based on the use cases, provide the viz options to the stakeholders which make sure the viz is not overcrowded (we recommend not to show more than five measures on a single viz). Plan the user journeys - consider what could be the entry points to the dashboard, and its tabs. Think of different options a user could try on the filters and how the data should display accordingly. To give a better sense of data to the users, group and categorise the related viz / tables. You can achieve this by using boxes, borders or background colours. Follow a consistent style for the text eg the links / buttons / information icons and anything that is interactive should be in blue throughout the dashboards. Wherever possible, update the results on the dashboard only after the user selects all the required attributes within a filter and click the 'apply' button, rather than updating it for every single option selection. Minimise the use of colour in wireframes wherever possible. In a few instances when the wireframes aren't the best solution, start with the sketches and present your ideas to the stakeholders. Simplicity is key Avoid designs that will confuse or will make it difficult for them to navigate. Consider quality not quantity, don't overload the view. Design guidelines Things to consider when designing your dashboard The first place your eyes go to is the top of a screen. Placing information here will create a good visual hierarchy that users can easily scan. Use consistent size for all dashboards in a workbook. Guidelines and borders should be used sparingly and only when absolutely needed. Without any white space, your dashboard will look cluttered. This makes it difficult to distinguish which information is the most important. Grouping like data together will allow users to navigate through the information easily. The NHS logo should be placed on the top right hand corner of each dashboard tab. Stand far back from your screen to check your layout and presentation. Print the views in black and white to consider how it may look for people printing the report or for another perspective. There should not be any nulls on dashboards. Use appropriate values to replace these i.e. 'Unknown' or 'Not Applicable'. Effective communication Things you should consider to better communicate information to users. Consider your audience and your message carefully before starting to design your report and dashboard. Apply a clear and consistent style across reports. Avoid overloading reports - remove any elements that are not needed to convey the message. Use colours and shapes economically, limiting the number of colours and shapes in a report or a dashboard. Use fonts consistently as per this design guide. Emphasise key information while de-emphasising less important information. Use sizing effectively to make sure your visualisation and text is easily visible. Ensure methodologies are included, especially when including metrics or statistics.","title":"Sketches, Wireframes and Prototypes"},{"location":"dashboard_lifecycle/sketches_wireframes_prototypes/#sketches-wireframes-and-prototypes","text":"","title":"Sketches, Wireframes and Prototypes"},{"location":"dashboard_lifecycle/sketches_wireframes_prototypes/#whats-in-a-name","text":"From low levels of fidelity sketching to high levels of fidelity prototypes, each has its place in communicating your dashboard ideas to stakeholders and for generating feedback.
